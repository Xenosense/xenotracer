## Development

Do these steps to start developing

- Install npm first: we use 16.x version. [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/)
- Install yarn [Here](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/)

Then do these steps!
```
yarn
yarn install
```

It will download all required packages

We use [commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli) to do commit. 

Initialize the commitizen (if you haven't) by using this command.

```
commitizen init cz-conventional-changelog --yarn --dev --exact
```

If you get error that it's already setup, ignore it.

Tada~ Happy coding!
